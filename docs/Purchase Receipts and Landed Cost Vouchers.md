# Purchase Receipts and Landed Cost Vouchers

In the fourth chapter of the Inventory Management course from Frappe School, the focus is on **purchase receipts** and **landed cost vouchers** in ERPNext. Here's a summary:

1. **Purchase Receipts**:

   - Also known as Goods Received Notes (GRNs), purchase receipts document the receipt of goods, including item details, quantities, rates, and the warehouse where the items are received.
   - The valuation of goods includes additional costs such as freight, taxes, and duties, not just the purchase price.
   - Purchase receipts can be created directly or linked to purchase orders, allowing users to add items from previous orders and assign them to accepted or rejected warehouses.
   - Upon submission, stock ledger entries are created for accepted items, updating the linked purchase order.

2. **Landed Cost Vouchers**:
   - These vouchers allow the addition of extra costs (e.g., taxes and transport) to an item, ensuring accurate pricing and profitability.
   - Users can create landed cost vouchers by selecting purchase receipts or invoices and adding relevant additional charges.
   - The system recalculates item rates based on the landed costs, posting ledger entries accordingly.
   - Charges can also be added directly in the purchase receipt to impact the item's valuation.

The chapter concludes with a preview of the next chapter, which will cover stock entries. For further learning, users can visit the ERPNext documentation.
