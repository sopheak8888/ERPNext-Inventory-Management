# Reports and Dashboard

In this chapter of the Frappe School inventory management course, the focus is on reports and dashboards available in ERPNext's inventory module. Here's a summary:

1. **Importance of Inventory Reporting**: Effective inventory management relies on accurate reporting to prevent stock shortages and overstocking, both of which can impact sales and cash flow.

2. **Stock Ledger Entry List**: This tool allows users to view all stock transactions but does not allow for new entries. It can be filtered by item code, warehouse, or voucher.

3. **Stock Ledger**: A detailed record of stock movements, showing inward and outward transactions related to manufacturing, purchasing, and sales. This helps provide a granular view of inventory.

4. **Quick Stock Balance**: Retrieves the current balance and value of stock items in real time, useful for audits and transaction verification.

5. **Stock Balance Report**: Shows stock transactions based on sales and purchase invoices, providing insights into in and out quantities and valuations.

6. **Delivery Note Trends**: Analyzes delivery notes over various periods (monthly, quarterly, etc.) and can be filtered by items, customers, or projects.

7. **Purchase Receipts Trends**: Similar to delivery notes, this report analyzes purchase receipts over chosen time frames.

8. **Stock Levels Reports**:

   - **Stock Projected Quantity Report**: Displays actual and planned stock levels, helping monitor reorder points and safety stock.
   - **Item Shortage Report**: Identifies items needing replenishment soon, assisting in reconciling stock balances.

9. **Stock Dashboard**: Provides an overview of active items, warehouse counts, and total stock value, with options to include various reports.

The chapter concludes by encouraging users to refer to the official ERPNext documentation for more detailed information.
