# Inventory Accounting

In this chapter of the inventory management course from Frappe School, the focus is on **inventory accounting** within ERPNext. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points covered:

1. **Types of Inventory Systems**:

   - **Periodic Inventory System**: Best for smaller companies with minimal inventory. Requires manual updates for accounting and can lead to inaccuracies due to lack of real-time data.
   - **Perpetual Inventory System**: Suitable for larger companies, providing real-time updates on inventory and cost of goods sold (COGS) as transactions occur. It automates inventory accounting, making it easier but potentially more complex to correct errors.

2. **Inventory Valuation Methods**:

   - Two primary methods are discussed: **FIFO (First In, First Out)** and **Moving Average**. These methods determine how individual inventory units are valued.

3. **Setting Up ERPNext**:

   - Users must enable the perpetual inventory setting in stock settings and set up default accounts in the chart of accounts for inventory management.

4. **Transaction Examples**:

   - **Purchase Receipt**: Demonstrated how inventory increases when a purchase is made and how this affects accounts.
   - **Purchase Invoice**: Showed the accounting entries when an invoice is created for a received purchase.
   - **Delivery Note**: Explained how delivering items impacts both stock and general ledgers.
   - **Sales Invoice**: Discussed creating invoices without a delivery note and how it still affects inventory accounts.
   - **Material Receipt and Issue**: Examples showed how stock adjustments are made in both scenarios.
   - **Material Transfer**: Illustrated the effects of transferring materials between warehouses.

5. **Inventory Valuation Comparison**:
   - An example compared FIFO and Moving Average methods for valuing shares, demonstrating how FIFO tends to yield higher gross profits due to the timing of inventory costs.

The chapter concludes by emphasizing the benefits of using ERPNext for real-time inventory tracking and accounting efficiency. The next chapter will cover opening stock balances and stock reconciliation.
