# Inventory Management Intro

In this introductory video for the inventory management course at Frappe School, the speaker highlights the limitations of traditional accounting software and spreadsheets in managing inventory. While these systems may ensure compliance, they often lead to inconsistent data and manual, tedious tasks like stock reporting and reconciliation.

ERPNext is introduced as a robust solution with a comprehensive inventory management module, allowing for efficient management of stock transactions, including purchase receipts, delivery notes, and stock entries. It also enables product traceability and offers built-in inventory reports for better visibility.

The course consists of 10 chapters covering key topics such as master data management, the impact of inventory on accounting, adding opening stock, recording inventory receipts, creating delivery notes and packing slips, managing warehouses, and generating reports based on captured data.
