# Warehouse Management

In this chapter of the inventory management course from Frappe School, the focus is on warehouse management within ERPNext. The key topics covered include

1. **Put Away Rules**: These define strategies for storing incoming stock, considering warehouse capacity and item priority. Users learn to set up these rules based on warehouse layout and item classification.

2. **Pick Lists**: Pick lists organize the picking process for fulfilling orders or transferring items internally. They are particularly useful for high volumes of orders or numerous SKUs, streamlining the picking process.

3. **Auto Reorder**: This feature helps maintain optimal inventory levels, preventing overstocking or stock out. Users can configure auto reorder settings in the item master, defining reorder levels and quantities based on consumption and lead time.

The chapter includes practical steps for using these features in ERPNext, such as creating and applying put away rules, generating pick lists from sales or work orders, and setting up auto reordering to manage stock levels efficiently.

The session concludes by encouraging learners to explore more about ERPNext and mentions the upcoming chapter focusing on reports and dashboards.
