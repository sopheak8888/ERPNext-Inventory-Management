# Delivery Note and Packing Slip

In the sixth chapter of the inventory management course from Frappe School, the focus is on **delivery notes** and **packing slips** in ERPNext. Here's a summary:

1. **Delivery Note**:

   - A document that records the delivery of goods from the warehouse, reducing stock.
   - Usually optional and provided to the transporter, it helps in tracking partial deliveries.
   - Created from a submitted sales order; users can manually create it from the delivery note list as well.
   - Users select the customer, fetch items from the sales order, and can add details like taxes, transport information, and discounts before saving.

2. **Pick List**:

   - A document indicating which items to retrieve from inventory for fulfilling orders.
   - Created in the stock module and can be associated with a sales order for delivery.
   - Users can select different purposes for creating the pick list and specify item locations before saving.

3. **Packing Slip**:
   - Lists all items in a shipment and accompanies the delivered goods.
   - Created from a draft delivery note, allowing users to edit items, define package numbers, and add weight details.
   - Multiple packing slips can be generated from one delivery note, and users can also create it manually.

The chapter concludes by encouraging further learning about ERPNext on its documentation site and hints at the next topic on inventory traceability.
