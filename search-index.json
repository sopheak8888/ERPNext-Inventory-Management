inventory management course at Frappe School, the speaker highlights the limitations of traditional accounting software and spreadsheets in managing inventory. While these systems may ensure compliance, they often lead to inconsistent data and manual, tedious tasks like stock reporting and reconciliation. ERPNext is introduced as a robust solution with a comprehensive inventory management module, allowing for efficient management of stock transactions, including purchase receipts, delivery notes, and stock entries. It also enables product traceability and offers built-in inventory reports for better visibility. The course consists of 10 chapters covering key topics such as master data management, the impact of inventory on accounting, adding opening stock, recording inventory receipts, creating delivery notes and packing slips, managing warehouses, and generating reports based on captured data.","s":"Inventory Management Intro","u":"/ERPNext-Inventory-Management/docs/intro","h":"","p":6},{"i":9,"t":"In the sixth chapter of the inventory management course from Frappe School, the focus is on delivery notes and packing slips in ERPNext. Here's a summary: Delivery Note: A document that records the delivery of goods from the warehouse, reducing stock. Usually optional and provided to the transporter, it helps in tracking partial deliveries. Created from a submitted sales order; users can manually create it from the delivery note list as well. Users select the customer, fetch items from the sales order, and can add details like taxes, transport information, and discounts before saving. Pick List: A document indicating which items to retrieve from inventory for fulfilling orders. Created in the stock module and can be associated with a sales order for delivery. Users can select different purposes for creating the pick list and specify item locations before saving. Packing Slip: Lists all items in a shipment and accompanies the delivered goods. Created from a draft delivery note, allowing users to edit items, define package numbers, and add weight details. Multiple packing slips can be generated from one delivery note, and users can also create it manually. The chapter concludes by encouraging further learning about ERPNext on its documentation site and hints at the next topic on inventory traceability.","s":"Delivery Note and Packing Slip","u":"/ERPNext-Inventory-Management/docs/Delivery Note and Packing Slip","h":"","p":8},{"i":11,"t":"Overview of Master Data: Master data refers to the central database that defines entities for standardization across an organization. Two essential masters for inventory management are items and warehouses. Item Master: The item master is crucial for recording transactions (buying, selling, transferring). Correctly creating the item master is vital; errors can lead to transaction inaccuracies. Warehouses: In ERPNext, a warehouse encompasses more than just storage buildings; it includes sub-locations like shelves. Proper warehouse definition enhances reporting capabilities. Stock Settings: Stock settings are accessed via the awesome bar in ERPNext. Users can configure item naming conventions, default item groups, units of measure, and more. Settings include transaction tolerances, automatic price updates, stock visibility, and quality inspection protocols. Creating Warehouses: Warehouses are organized in a tree format within ERPNext. Users can create new warehouses, define types, and add addresses and contact details. Item Groups: Item groups help classify items by type and are also displayed in a tree format. Users can create parent and child groups for better organization. Creating Item Masters: Users navigate to the item list to create a new item by filling out necessary fields, such as item code and group. Various settings can be adjusted, including enabling stock maintenance, defining valuation methods, and automatic reordering. Advanced Item Details: Users can specify alternative units of measure, supplier information, sales details, tax rates, and quality inspection criteria. Conclusion: This chapter provided insights into setting up master data and configuring stock settings in ERPNext. The next chapter will cover the basics of inventory accounting.","s":"Master Data Management","u":"/ERPNext-Inventory-Management/docs/Master Data Management","h":"","p":10},{"i":13,"t":"In this chapter of the inventory management course from Frappe School, the focus is on inventory accounting within ERPNext. Here’s a summary of the key points covered: Types of Inventory Systems: Periodic Inventory System: Best for smaller companies with minimal inventory. Requires manual updates for accounting and can lead to inaccuracies due to lack of real-time data. Perpetual Inventory System: Suitable for larger companies, providing real-time updates on inventory and cost of goods sold (COGS) as transactions occur. It automates inventory accounting, making it easier but potentially more complex to correct errors. Inventory Valuation Methods: Two primary methods are discussed: FIFO (First In, First Out) and Moving Average. These methods determine how individual inventory units are valued. Setting Up ERPNext: Users must enable the perpetual inventory setting in stock settings and set up default accounts in the chart of accounts for inventory management. Transaction Examples: Purchase Receipt: Demonstrated how inventory increases when a purchase is made and how this affects accounts. Purchase Invoice: Showed the accounting entries when an invoice is created for a received purchase. Delivery Note: Explained how delivering items impacts both stock and general ledgers. Sales Invoice: Discussed creating invoices without a delivery note and how it still affects inventory accounts. Material Receipt and Issue: Examples showed how stock adjustments are made in both scenarios. Material Transfer: Illustrated the effects of transferring materials between warehouses. Inventory Valuation Comparison: An example compared FIFO and Moving Average methods for valuing shares, demonstrating how FIFO tends to yield higher gross profits due to the timing of inventory costs. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the benefits of using ERPNext for real-time inventory tracking and accounting efficiency. The next chapter will cover opening stock balances and stock reconciliation.","s":"Inventory Accounting","u":"/ERPNext-Inventory-Management/docs/Inventory Accounting","h":"","p":12},{"i":15,"t":"In this chapter, the focus is on opening stock balance and stock reconciliation within the ERPNext system. By the end, you should understand how to: Add Opening Stock: When migrating from legacy software, upload the closing stock as opening stock in ERPNext, using a cutoff date (e.g., if starting on April 1, the cutoff is March 31). Ensure that items are configured properly in the item master, particularly checking the \"maintained stock\" box. Two methods to add opening stock: Using Stock Entry: Record item movement between warehouses. Specify the stock entry type (e.g., material receipt), target warehouse, item details (code, quantity, rate), and save the entry. Stock Reconciliation: Set the purpose to \"opening stock,\" select items, and submit. Conduct Stock Reconciliation: A process that compares physical stock with system stock to correct discrepancies. Navigate to stock reconciliation, set the purpose, and enter the relevant details (item code, warehouse, quantity, valuation rate). Adjustments are recorded in both stock and accounting ledgers, ensuring that post-reconciliation transactions do not alter previously set stock balances. Examples and Practical Use Cases: Stock balances from prior transactions remain unchanged after reconciliation. Adjusting stock for serialized or batched items is possible through the reconciliation process, allowing for updates in quantities and valuation rates. The chapter concludes with a note on further learning resources available on the ERPNext documentation site and previews the next chapter's topics on purchase receipts and landed cost vouchers.","s":"Opening Stock Balance and Reconciliation","u":"/ERPNext-Inventory-Management/docs/Opening Stock Balance and Reconciliation","h":"","p":14},{"i":17,"t":"Welcome to My ERPNext Inventory Management Documentation Project Hello and welcome to my documentation project on ERPNext inventory management!

ERPNext is a powerful enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that helps businesses manage their operations more efficiently. In this project, I'll be focusing on one of the most critical aspects of ERPNext: inventory management. Why Inventory Management? Inventory management is the backbone of any business that deals with physical products. It's essential to have a robust system in place to track inventory levels, manage stock movements, and optimize storage and shipping processes. ERPNext offers a comprehensive inventory management module that can help businesses streamline their operations and improve their bottom line. What to Expect from This Project In this project, I'll be creating detailed documentation on ERPNext inventory management, covering topics such as: Setting up and configuring the inventory management module Managing inventory items, warehouses, and stock movements Tracking inventory levels and optimizing stock levels Using reports and analytics to gain insights into inventory performance My goal is to provide a comprehensive resource that will help businesses get the most out of ERPNext's inventory management capabilities. Whether you're a business owner, a system administrator, or an end-user, I hope to provide you with the knowledge and expertise you need to succeed. Stay Tuned! I'll be regularly updating this blog with new articles, tutorials, and tips on ERPNext inventory management. If you have any questions or topics you'd like me to cover, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's get started on this journey to mastering ERPNext inventory management! Best regards, Lim Sopheak","s":"Welcome","u":"/ERPNext-Inventory-Management/blog/welcome","h":"","p":16},{"i":19,"t":"In this chapter of the Frappe School inventory management course, the focus is on reports and dashboards available in ERPNext's inventory module. Here's a summary: Importance of Inventory Reporting: Effective inventory management relies on accurate reporting to prevent stock shortages and overstocking, both of which can impact sales and cash flow. Stock Ledger Entry List: This tool allows users to view all stock transactions but does not allow for new entries. It can be filtered by item code, warehouse, or voucher. Stock Ledger: A detailed record of stock movements, showing inward and outward transactions related to manufacturing, purchasing, and sales. This helps provide a granular view of inventory. Quick Stock Balance: Retrieves the current balance and value of stock items in real time, useful for audits and transaction verification. Stock Balance Report: Shows stock transactions based on sales and purchase invoices, providing insights into in and out quantities and valuations. Delivery Note Trends: Analyzes delivery notes over various periods (monthly, quarterly, etc.) and can be filtered by items, customers, or projects. Purchase Receipts Trends: Similar to delivery notes, this report analyzes purchase receipts over chosen time frames. Stock Levels Reports: Stock Projected Quantity Report: Displays actual and planned stock levels, helping monitor reorder points and safety stock. Item Shortage Report: Identifies items needing replenishment soon, assisting in reconciling stock balances. Stock Dashboard: Provides an overview of active items, warehouse counts, and total stock value, with options to include various reports. The chapter concludes by encouraging users to refer to the official ERPNext documentation for more detailed information.","s":"Reports and Dashboard","u":"/ERPNext-Inventory-Management/docs/Reports and Dashboard","h":"","p":18},{"i":21,"t":"In the eighth chapter of the inventory management course from Frappe School, the focus is on returns in ERPNext. Here's a summary: Types of Returns: Purchase Returns: Goods returned to suppliers due to reasons like poor quality or overstock. This reduces inventory and liability to the supplier. Sales Returns: Goods returned by customers, which increases inventory and reduces receivables from customers. Recording Returns: Sales Return: Start by accessing the sales invoice list. Create or open a sales invoice and then create a delivery note for it. Use the \"Create\" button to select \"Sales Return,\" which generates a delivery note with the return checkbox selected. This process updates stock and accounting ledgers accordingly, affecting stock balance and customer accounts. Purchase Return: Access the purchase receipt list and create a new purchase receipt. Use the \"Create\" button to select \"Return,\" which generates a purchase receipt with the return checkbox selected. This decreases stock and adjusts the accounting ledger, affecting accounts such as \"stock in hand\" and \"received but not billed.\" System Updates: When returns are processed, the original document status changes (e.g., to \"return issued\"), and the system maintains accurate stock and accounting balances. The chapter concludes by directing users to further resources on ERPNext and hints at the next topic on warehouse management.","s":"Returns","u":"/ERPNext-Inventory-Management/docs/Returns","h":"","p":20},{"i":23,"t":"In the fourth chapter of the Inventory Management course from Frappe School, the focus is on purchase receipts and landed cost vouchers in ERPNext. Here's a summary: Purchase Receipts: Also known as Goods Received Notes (GRNs), purchase receipts document the receipt of goods, including item details, quantities, rates, and the warehouse where the items are received. The valuation of goods includes additional costs such as freight, taxes, and duties, not just the purchase price. Purchase receipts can be created directly or linked to purchase orders, allowing users to add items from previous orders and assign them to accepted or rejected warehouses. Upon submission, stock ledger entries are created for accepted items, updating the linked purchase order. Landed Cost Vouchers: These vouchers allow the addition of extra costs (e.g., taxes and transport) to an item, ensuring accurate pricing and profitability. Users can create landed cost vouchers by selecting purchase receipts or invoices and adding relevant additional charges. The system recalculates item rates based on the landed costs, posting ledger entries accordingly. Charges can also be added directly in the purchase receipt to impact the item's valuation. The chapter concludes with a preview of the next chapter, which will cover stock entries. For further learning, users can visit the ERPNext documentation.","s":"Purchase Receipts and Landed Cost Vouchers","u":"/ERPNext-Inventory-Management/docs/Purchase Receipts and Landed Cost Vouchers","h":"","p":22},{"i":25,"t":"In this chapter of the inventory management course from Frappe School, the focus is on warehouse management within ERPNext. The key topics covered include Put Away Rules: These define strategies for storing incoming stock, considering warehouse capacity and item priority. Users learn to set up these rules based on warehouse layout and item classification. Pick Lists: Pick lists organize the picking process for fulfilling orders or transferring items internally. They are particularly useful for high volumes of orders or numerous SKUs, streamlining the picking process. Auto Reorder: This feature helps maintain optimal inventory levels, preventing overstocking or stock out. Users can configure auto reorder settings in the item master, defining reorder levels and quantities based on consumption and lead time. The chapter includes practical steps for using these features in ERPNext, such as creating and applying put away rules, generating pick lists from sales or work orders, and setting up auto reordering to manage stock levels efficiently. The session concludes by encouraging learners to explore more about ERPNext and mentions the upcoming chapter focusing on reports and dashboards.","s":"Warehouse Management","u":"/ERPNext-Inventory-Management/docs/Warehouse Management","h":"","p":24},{"i":27,"t":"Stock Transfers: Intra-company transfers (between warehouses within the same company) and inter-company transfers (between different companies). Stock Entry Types: Material Issue: Recording the consumption of low-value items. Material Receipt: Logging inward stock, including serialized items. Material Transfer: Moving materials for manufacturing or projects. Manufacturing: Recording production and raw material consumption. Sent to Subcontractor: Transferring inventory to a subcontractor. Repack: Converting bulk items into smaller units. Creating Stock Entries: Selecting stock entry types, source and target warehouses, and adding items. Fetching items from related documents like purchase orders or bills of materials. Adjusting posting dates, adding inspection options, and tracking accounting dimensions. Delivery Notes and Purchase Receipts: Used for material transfers with statutory requirements (taxes). Configuration steps for using delivery notes and purchase receipts for internal transfers. Sales and Purchase Invoices: Using sales invoices to apply taxes on transfers and creating corresponding purchase invoices. The chapter provides a comprehensive guide on using ERPNext for managing stock transfers, customizing entries, and handling accounting aspects.","s":"Stock
